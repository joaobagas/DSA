## Introduction

I am going to use this repository to implement some Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Contents

This repository will include implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages. The focus will be on efficiency, clarity, and best practices.

### Data Structures (To be implemented)

- Arrays;
- Linked Lists;
- Stacks;
- Queues;
- Hash Tables;
- Trees;
- Graphs;

### Algorithms (To be implemented)

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.);
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, etc.);
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.);
- Among others;
